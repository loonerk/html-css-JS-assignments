       People from Mayo, QC to Seattle, WA flock to catch a glimpse of the beast. He is so elusive. Very mysterious. Hates children. Only one rule: No Dogs Allowed.

      <h4>AKA An Excellent Cat</h4>
        Zeus is an excellent cat. He is a regal beast, he has a kind soul, and is old as sin. Maybe older than time itself. He loves tuna soup. Alas, what a time to be a cat.
